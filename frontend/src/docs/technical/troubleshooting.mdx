# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them.

## Connection Issues

### "Failed to connect to Monarch Money"

This usually means your Monarch credentials need to be re-entered.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Credentials**
2. Re-enter your Monarch email and password
3. Enter your passphrase to save

:::note
If you recently changed your Monarch password, you'll need to update it in Eclosion as well.
:::

### Session Expired

If you see a session expired message, simply log in again with your passphrase. Your data is preserved.

## Sync Issues

### Categories Not Syncing

If your Monarch categories aren't appearing:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Sync**
2. Select **Force Full Sync**
3. Wait for the sync to complete

This refreshes all category data from Monarch.

### Transactions Missing

Eclosion syncs transaction data periodically. If recent transactions are missing:

- Wait a few minutes and refresh the page
- Check that the transaction is visible in Monarch Money first
- Use the manual sync option in Settings
