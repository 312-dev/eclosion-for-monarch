# Recurring Expenses

The Recurring tab is the heart of Eclosion. Here you can track all your recurring bills, subscriptions, and regular expenses.

## Overview

Your recurring expenses are organized into two main areas:

### The Rollup Zone

The rollup combines smaller recurring charges into a single Monarch category. This is useful for:

- Streaming subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
- Small monthly fees
- Any expenses you want to budget together

### Individual Items

Expenses tracked individually, each with their own Monarch category. Use this for:

- Major bills (rent, utilities)
- Expenses you want to track separately
- Items with variable amounts

## Adding New Items

To add a recurring expense:

1. Select the **Add Item** button
2. Enter the expense details (name, amount, frequency)
3. Choose whether to add to the rollup or track individually
4. Link to an existing Monarch category or create a new one

:::note
Changes sync automatically with your Monarch account. You don't need to manually sync after adding items.

## Managing Existing Items

Select any item to:

- Edit its details
- Change the amount or frequency
- Move it between rollup and individual tracking
- Delete it from tracking
