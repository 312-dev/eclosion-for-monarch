# Recurring Expenses

The Recurring tab is the heart of Eclosion. Track all your recurring bills, subscriptions, and regular expenses in one place.

</FeatureGrid>

## How It Works

Your recurring expenses are organized into two main areas:

### The Rollup Zone

The rollup combines smaller recurring charges into a single Monarch category. This is useful for:

- Streaming subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
- Small monthly fees
- Any expenses you want to budget together

### Dedicated Categories

Larger expenses tracked individually, each with their own Monarch category. Use this for:

- Major bills (rent, utilities)
- Expenses you want to track separately
- Items with variable amounts

## How Items Are Added

Recurring items are automatically detected from your Monarch account. Eclosion syncs with Monarch to find transactions marked as recurring.

:::note
Changes sync automatically with your Monarch account. New recurring transactions from Monarch will appear after each sync.

## Managing Existing Items

Select any item to:

- Edit its name and emoji
- View its amount and payment frequency
- Move it between the rollup zone and dedicated categories
- Toggle tracking on or off

## Auto-Categorization

Eclosion can automatically categorize new recurring transactions as they're imported into Monarch.

### How It Works

When enabled, during each sync:

1. Eclosion fetches recent recurring transactions from Monarch
2. Matches them to your tracked recurring items using the recurring stream ID
3. Updates each transaction's category to the corresponding tracking category

This ensures new charges from tracked subscriptions are automatically categorized correctly.

### Enabling Auto-Categorization

You can enable auto-categorization in two ways:

- **During setup**: Check the "Auto-categorize new transactions" option in the rollup configuration step
- **In Settings**: Toggle "Auto-categorize transactions" under Recurring settings

:::note
Auto-categorization only affects new transactions going forward. It does not modify past transactions.

### Historical Accuracy

For accurate historical reports in Monarch, you may want to manually re-categorize past transactions to their tracking categories. This can be done directly in Monarch's Transactions view:

1. Filter transactions by the merchant name
2. Select the transactions you want to re-categorize
3. Change their category to the tracking category

This one-time step ensures your spending reports accurately reflect the full history of each recurring expense.
