# Setup Wizard

The setup wizard helps you configure recurring expense tracking for the first time. It guides you through connecting to Monarch and setting up your categories.

## Starting the Wizard

The wizard launches automatically when you first access the Recurring tab. If you need to reconfigure, you can reset your setup from Settings.

## Steps

### 1. Category

Choose or create a category group in Monarch to organize your recurring expenses. All tracking categories will be created within this group.

### 2. Items

Review recurring expenses detected from your Monarch transaction history and select which ones to track. You can:

- Select individual items or use "Select All" to track everything
- Link items to existing Monarch categories if you already have them set up
- Items you don't select will still appear later but won't be actively tracked

### 3. Rollup

Configure the rollup category and automation settings:

- **Create or link a rollup category**: Choose whether to create a new rollup category or use an existing Monarch category to combine smaller subscriptions
- **Auto-categorize transactions**: Optionally enable automatic categorization of new recurring transactions to their tracking categories during sync

:::tip
Enabling auto-categorization saves time by automatically sorting new subscription charges into the right categories during each sync.

Click **Finish Setup** to complete configuration and start tracking.

:::tip
You can always modify your settings later. The wizard just gets you started quickly.
