# Setup Wizard

The setup wizard helps you configure recurring expense tracking for the first time. It guides you through connecting to Monarch and setting up your categories.

## Starting the Wizard

The wizard launches automatically when you first access the Recurring tab, or you can start it manually from Settings.

## Steps

### 1. Welcome

A brief introduction to what the wizard will set up.

### 2. Category Group

Choose or create a category group in Monarch to organize your recurring expenses.

### 3. Item Selection

Review detected recurring expenses from your transaction history and select which ones to track.

### 4. Rollup Configuration

Decide which items should be combined into a rollup category versus tracked individually.

### 5. Finish

Review your configuration and complete the setup.

You can always modify your settings later. The wizard just gets you started quickly.
