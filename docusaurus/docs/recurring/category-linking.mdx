# Category Linking

Category linking connects your Eclosion recurring items to existing categories in Monarch Money.

## When to Link

Link a category when:

- You already have a category in Monarch for an expense
- You want to preserve your existing budget structure
- You're migrating from manual tracking to Eclosion

## How to Link

1. Click the link icon next to any recurring item
2. Search or browse available categories from your Monarch budget
3. Select the category you want to link
4. Choose whether to rename the category to match the recurring item
5. Click **Link Category** to confirm

The item will now use that category for all transaction categorization.

## Name Sync Options

When linking, you can choose:

- **Rename to match recurring item**: Updates the Monarch category name to match the recurring expense (e.g., "Netflix")
- **Keep existing name**: Preserves the original category name in Monarch

## Automatic Category Creation

If you don't link to an existing category, Eclosion will automatically create a new category in Monarch when the item is enabled for tracking. The category is created within your configured category group.

Already have a category set up? Use the link icon next to any item to quickly connect it and avoid creating duplicates.
