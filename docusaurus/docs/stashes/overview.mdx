# Stashes

Create a visual dashboard of savings goals for things you want. Set target amounts and dates, track your progress with status badges, and organize cards your way with drag and drop.

<FeatureGrid>
  <FeatureCard
    icon={<Grid size={24} />}
    title="Visual Dashboard"
    description="Drag, drop, and resize cards to organize your goals"

  <FeatureCard

    description="See at a glance if you're funded, on track, or behind"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    icon={<Target size={24} />}
    title="Target Dates"

  <FeatureCard

  />
</FeatureGrid>

## How It Works

Stashes represent savings goals for things you want, unlike recurring expenses which repeat on a schedule. Each stash has:

- **Target amount**: How much you need to save
- **Target date**: When you want to have the money ready
- **Monthly target**: Calculated automatically based on your progress and timeline

### Visual Cards

Items display as resizable cards you can arrange in a grid. Each card shows:

- Item name and image (favicon, emoji, or custom upload)
- Progress bar and percentage
- Current balance vs. target amount
- Status badge (Funded, On Track, Behind, etc.)

Drag cards to rearrange them, or resize by dragging the corners.

## Starting a New Stash

  steps={[
    {
      title: "Click Start a Stash",
      description: "Click the Start a Stash button in the Stashes header to open the new stash form."
    },
    {
      title: "Enter Details",
      description: "Give your item a name, target amount, and target date. Optionally add a URL, emoji, or custom image."
    },
    {
      title: "Link a Category",
      description: "Choose an existing Monarch category or create a new one. This is where your savings will be tracked."
    },
    {
      title: "Start Saving",
      description: "Your item appears on the dashboard. Budget to your linked category and watch progress grow."
    }
  ]}
/>

## Browser Bookmark Sync

Eclosion can sync with your browser's bookmarks to automatically detect stashes. This is useful for tracking products you've bookmarked while shopping online.

### Supported Browsers

- Firefox
- Chrome
- Edge
- Safari

### Setting Up Browser Sync

1. Click the gear icon in the Stashes header
2. Select your browser from the dropdown
3. Choose which bookmark folders to monitor
4. Save your settings

Once configured, Eclosion checks your bookmarks during each sync. New bookmarks appear in the "Pending Review" section where you can:

- **Create Target**: Convert the bookmark into a stash
- **Skip**: Ignore the bookmark (it won't appear again)

:::tip
Create a dedicated "Wishlist" folder in your browser bookmarks. Point Eclosion at just that folder to avoid seeing unrelated bookmarks.
:::

## Managing Items

Click any card to edit its details:

- Update name, amount, or target date
- Change the emoji or upload a custom image
- View or modify the linked category

### Archiving Completed Goals

When you've saved enough for an item (or purchased it), you can archive it:

1. Click the item card to open the edit modal
2. Click "Archive" in the actions menu
3. The item moves to the Archived section at the bottom

Archived items are hidden by default but can be expanded to view your savings history.

## Monthly Targets

Like recurring expenses, Eclosion calculates how much you need to save each month to reach your goal by the target date.

### The Calculation

The remaining amount is spread across months until your target date:

| Item | Target | Saved | Months Left | Monthly Target |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| New laptop | $1,500 | $500 | 5 months | $200/mo |
| Vacation | $3,000 | $1,200 | 6 months | $300/mo |
| Camera | $800 | $0 | 8 months | $100/mo |

### Funded Items

Once your balance reaches the target amount, the item shows as "Funded" and the monthly target drops to $0. The item remains visible until you archive it.

:::note
Stash targets use the same rounding rules as recurring expenses. Small targets show at least $1/month.
:::

## Status Badges

Each item displays a status badge based on your progress:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Funded** | You've saved enough for this item |
| **Ahead** | You're budgeting more than the monthly target |
| **On Track** | You're meeting the monthly target |
| **Behind** | You're budgeting less than needed |

Status is recalculated whenever your balance or budget changes.
