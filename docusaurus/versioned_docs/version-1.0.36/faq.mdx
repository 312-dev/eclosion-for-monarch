# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is Eclosion free?

Yes! Eclosion is completely free and open source. You can use it without any cost, and the source code is available on GitHub for review or contribution.

## How does Eclosion connect to Monarch Money?

Eclosion uses your Monarch Money credentials to authenticate directly with their API. Your credentials are stored securely on your device and are never sent to any third-party servers.

## Is the app signed and secure?

The macOS version is fully signed and notarized by Apple, so it installs seamlessly. Windows and Linux builds are currently unsigned, but you can verify the source code on GitHub and build the app yourself if preferred.

## Does Eclosion work on all operating systems?

Eclosion is available for macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Windows (x64), and Linux (x64). You can also use the web-based demo to try it out before downloading.

## Will my data be safe?

Absolutely. Eclosion only communicates with Monarch Money servers. There are no analytics, telemetry, or third-party services. Your financial data stays between you and Monarch.

## What happens if Monarch releases a similar feature?

We deliberately focus on features outside Monarch's near-term roadmap. If Monarch does release comparable functionality, we'll provide a migration option so you can port your data to their native implementation. Our goal is to enhance your Monarch experience, not compete with it.
