# Recurring Expenses

The Recurring tab is the heart of Eclosion. Track all your recurring bills, subscriptions, and regular expenses in one place.

<FeatureGrid>
  <FeatureCard

    title="Rollup Zone"
    description="Combine small subscriptions into a single budget category"
  />
  <FeatureCard
    icon="📋"
    title="Individual Tracking"
    description="Track major bills separately with their own categories"
  />
  <FeatureCard

    title="Auto Sync"

  />
</FeatureGrid>

## How It Works

Your recurring expenses are organized into two main areas:

### The Rollup Zone

The rollup combines smaller recurring charges into a single Monarch category. This is useful for:

- Streaming subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
- Small monthly fees
- Any expenses you want to budget together

### Individual Items

Expenses tracked individually, each with their own Monarch category. Use this for:

- Major bills (rent, utilities)
- Expenses you want to track separately
- Items with variable amounts

## Adding New Items

<WorkflowSteps
  title="Add a Recurring Expense"
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Select Add Item",
      description: "Click the Add Item button in the top toolbar to open the new expense form."
    },
    {
      title: "Enter Details",
      description: "Fill in the expense name, amount, and how often it recurs (monthly, yearly, etc.)."
    },
    {
      title: "Choose Tracking",
      description: "Decide whether to add this to the rollup zone or track it as an individual item."
    },
    {
      title: "Link Category",
      description: "Connect to an existing Monarch category or create a new one. The expense will sync automatically."
    }
  ]}
/>

:::note
Changes sync automatically with your Monarch account. You don't need to manually sync after adding items.

## Managing Existing Items

Select any item to:

- Edit its details
- Change the amount or frequency
- Move it between rollup and individual tracking
- Delete it from tracking
