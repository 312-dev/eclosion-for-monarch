# Rollup Category

The rollup category is a powerful feature that combines multiple small recurring expenses into a single budget line in Monarch.

## Why Use a Rollup?

Instead of having dozens of small categories like "Netflix", "Spotify", "Disney+", etc., you can group them into a single "Streaming" or "Subscriptions" category.

Benefits:

- Cleaner budget view in Monarch
- Easier to track total spending on similar items
- Less category clutter

## How It Works

1. Items added to the rollup share a single Monarch category
2. The rollup total is the sum of all included items
3. Transactions are automatically categorized to the rollup category

## Configuring the Rollup

To modify your rollup:

1. Go to the Recurring tab
2. Click the rollup zone header to expand it
3. Remove items from the rollup using the remove button on each row
4. Click the rollup name to edit it, or click the emoji to change it

To add items to the rollup, find them in the Dedicated Categories section and click the "Add to rollup" button.

:::note
Moving an item out of the rollup will create a dedicated category for it in Monarch.
