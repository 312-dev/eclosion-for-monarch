# Monthly Notes

The Notes tab helps you remember why you set each budget. Add notes to any Monarch category or category group that carry forward each month.

## How It Works

Your notes are organized to match your Monarch category structure:

### Category Groups

Category groups from Monarch appear as expandable sections. Click a group to see its categories. You can add notes to both the group level and individual categories within it.

### General Month Notes

Use the sidebar (desktop) or top section (mobile) for notes that don't belong to a specific category. Great for:

- Monthly goals and priorities
- Budget reminders
- End-of-month summaries

## Adding Notes

    },
    {
      title: "Find a Category",

    },
    {
      title: "Click Add Note",
      description: "Click the \"+ Add note\" button next to the category name."
    },
    {
      title: "Write Your Note",
      description: "Type your note using markdown formatting. Notes save automatically as you type."
    }
  ]}
/>

:::tip
Notes support markdown formatting including **bold**, *italics*, bullet lists, and checkboxes. Use checkboxes to track action items for the month.

## Navigating Months

Use the month navigator at the top to move between months:

- **Arrow buttons**: Move forward or back one month at a time
- **Click month/year**: Jump directly to any month with the calendar picker

When you navigate to a future month, your existing notes carry forward automatically. They'll appear as "inherited" until you modify them for that specific month.

## Inline Math

Type math expressions directly in your notes and press **Tab** to evaluate them. This is useful for quick calculations:

- `100 + 50` + Tab = `150`
- `1200 / 12` + Tab = `100`
- `250 * 1.08` + Tab = `270`

## Revision History

Every change to a note is saved in the revision history. Click the history icon on any note to:

- View all previous versions
- See when each change was made
- Restore a previous version if needed

## Exporting Notes

Export your notes to PDF for printing or sharing:

1. Click the **Export** button in the top right
2. Select a date range (single month or range)
3. Choose which category groups to include
4. Download the formatted PDF

:::note
Export is only available when you have at least one note in the selected range.
