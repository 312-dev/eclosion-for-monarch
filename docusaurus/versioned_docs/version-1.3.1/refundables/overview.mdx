# Refundables

Track purchases awaiting refunds or reimbursements. Tag transactions in Monarch, organize them with saved views, and match refund transactions when they arrive.

## How It Works

Refundables uses Monarch tags to identify transactions that need refunds. You create **saved views** that filter by tag (and optionally category) to organize different types of refundables—work expenses, insurance claims, product returns, etc.

When a refund arrives, you match the refund transaction to the original purchase. Eclosion tracks which refunds have been received and which are still pending.

## Getting Started

<WorkflowSteps
  title="Setting Up Refundables"
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Tag Transactions in Monarch",
      description: "Add tags like \"Pending Refund\" or \"Work Expense\" to transactions in Monarch that you expect to be refunded or reimbursed."
    },
    {
      title: "Create a Saved View",
      description: "Click the + button to create a view. Select which tags to include and optionally filter by category. Name it something descriptive like \"Insurance Claims\"."
    },
    {
      title: "Review Your Transactions",
      description: "Your tagged transactions appear in the view, filtered by date range. The tally bar at the top shows how much is pending."
    },
    {
      title: "Match Refunds",
      description: "When a refund arrives, click the checkbox next to the original transaction. Search for the refund transaction and confirm the match."
    }
  ]}
/>

## Saved Views

Saved views are tabs that filter transactions by Monarch tags. Each view can have:

- **Tags**: One or more Monarch tags to filter by (required)
- **Categories**: Optional category filter to narrow results further
- **Name**: A descriptive label shown on the tab

You can create multiple views for different workflows. For example:

| View | Tags | Use Case |
|------|------|----------|
| Insurance Claims | `Insurance Claim` | Medical bills awaiting insurance reimbursement |
| Work Expenses | `Work Expense` | Purchases your employer will reimburse |
| Returns | `Pending Refund` | Items you're returning to a store |

Views are reorderable—drag tabs to arrange them in your preferred order.

## Matching Refunds

When you receive a refund, match it to the original transaction:

1. Click the checkbox next to the original transaction
2. Search for the refund transaction by merchant name or amount
3. Select the matching refund from the results
4. Confirm the match

Matched transactions display with a green highlight showing the refund amount, merchant, date, and account.

### Tag Replacement

When matching, you can optionally replace the original tag with a different one (e.g., replace "Pending Refund" with "Refunded"). Configure a default replacement tag in Refundables settings.

### Skipping Transactions

If a transaction won't be refunded, you can skip it:

- Click the skip button next to the transaction, or
- Choose "Skip" in the match modal

Skipped transactions are hidden from the main list but viewable in a collapsible section below.

## Tally Bar

The tally bar at the top of each view summarizes your progress:

- **Total count**: Number of transactions in the view
- **Total amount**: Sum of all transaction amounts
- **Matched**: Amount that has been matched to refunds (green)
- **Remaining**: Amount still pending (orange, or green if fully matched)
- **Breakdown**: Count of matched, skipped, and pending transactions

## Date Range Filter

Filter transactions by time period:

- Last week, month, quarter, or year
- Custom date range
- All time

## Settings

Click the gear icon to configure:

- **Replacement Tag**: The tag to apply when matching (replaces the original tag in Monarch)
- **Replace by Default**: Whether tag replacement is enabled by default for new matches

:::tip
Create dedicated tags in Monarch before setting up views. Tags like "Pending Refund", "Work Expense", and "Refunded" make it easy to organize and track your refundables.
