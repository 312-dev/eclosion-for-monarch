# Rollup Category

The rollup category is a powerful feature that combines multiple small recurring expenses into a single budget line in Monarch.

## Why Use a Rollup?

Instead of having dozens of small categories like "Netflix", "Spotify", "Disney+", etc., you can group them into a single "Streaming" or "Subscriptions" category.

Benefits:

- Cleaner budget view in Monarch
- Easier to track total spending on similar items
- Less category clutter

## How It Works

1. Items added to the rollup share a single Monarch category
2. The rollup total is the sum of all included items
3. Transactions are automatically categorized to the rollup category

## Configuring the Rollup

To modify your rollup:

1. Go to the Recurring tab
2. Select the rollup zone settings (gear icon)
3. Add or remove items from the rollup
4. Adjust the rollup category name if needed

:::note
Moving an item out of the rollup creates a new individual category for it in Monarch.
