# Category Linking

Category linking connects your Eclosion recurring items to existing categories in Monarch Money.

## When to Link

Link a category when:

- You already have a category in Monarch for an expense
- You want to preserve your existing budget structure
- You're migrating from manual tracking to Eclosion

## How to Link

1. Select a recurring item
2. Choose **Link to Existing Category**
3. Select the Monarch category from the list
4. Confirm the connection

The item will now use that category for all transaction categorization.

## Creating New Categories

If you don't have an existing category:

1. Select **Create New Category**
2. Enter a name for the category
3. Choose a category group
4. The category is created in Monarch automatically
