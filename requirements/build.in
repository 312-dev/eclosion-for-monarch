# Eclosion for Monarch - Build Dependencies
# This file contains build tools used in CI workflows.
#
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT run pip-compile on this file!
# PyInstaller has platform-specific wheels, so requirements-build.txt is
# manually maintained with hashes for all platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux).
#
# To update requirements-build.txt:
#   1. Download wheels for each platform:
#      pip download pyinstaller==X.Y.Z -d /tmp/dl --no-deps --platform <platform>
#   2. Generate hashes: pip hash /tmp/dl/*.whl
#   3. Update requirements-build.txt with all platform hashes

pip==24.3.1
pyinstaller==6.11.1
