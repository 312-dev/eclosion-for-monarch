# OpenSSF Scorecard
# Runs security health checks and publishes results to scorecard.dev
# This enables the Scorecard badge in the README
#
# NOTE: Actions in this workflow use version tags instead of SHA hashes
# because Scorecard's publish_results feature requires version tags for
# workflow verification. See: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action#workflow-restrictions
